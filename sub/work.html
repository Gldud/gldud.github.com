                <span>I took an online tutorial when I became very interested in learning Javascript and it contained a real world project. 
                Thanks to this project, I made my own web application using those codes. In my web application, you can itemize the expense 
                while you travel and see charts according to the item or payment method generated by Google API.</span>

                <span>As I'm getting older, I'm more health-conscious and I feel that I don't have much time to buy a cake for someone's celebration. 
                The most important thing is that the cakes I got were unhealthy, tasted bad and stale. That's why I started to create an imaginary cake delivery service website. 
                You can get a cake to your doorstep just in time for celebrations.</span>

                <span>This website is based on an app that I designed. These days, many startup companies are launching their own apps and making websites that introduces their app services. That's why I designed and developed this Traveler website. I made this website with an entrepreneur mind, which means I took customers 
                that will use the app and visit the website into account.</span>

                <span>I love a website with a unique layout, so I wanted to experiment with this 
                while I was making my own portfolio site. However, it was hard to be original. I googled and analyzed many websites related to my idea. 
                After agonizing over how to best display my work and myself, this website was finally born.</span>
